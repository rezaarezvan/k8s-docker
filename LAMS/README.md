### A (horrible) **L**inear **A**lgebra **M**ultivariate **S**tatistics library

This is purely for me to play around and see if I'm capable to implement hard math concepts from scratch.

## Run
If you for some reason want to run the make file:
```
make
```

Note that **I** personally just include both the .h and respective .c file. Because I am too lazy to link.

Your choice.
